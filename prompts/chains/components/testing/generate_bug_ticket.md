# Bug Issue Ticket Generator

## Overview
This document outlines the process of generating bug issue tickets from test failures.

## Workflow
1. Test Failure Detection
   - Monitor test execution
   - Capture failure details
   - Determine severity and priority

2. Issue Creation
   - Load bug_issue_template.md
   - Populate template with failure details
   - Generate unique issue ID
   - Save to appropriate sprint backlog

3. Backlog Integration
   - Add to current sprint backlog
   - Update sprint metrics
   - Notify relevant team members

## Template Variables
- {test_name}: Name of the failing test
- {failure_type}: Type of failure (assertion, timeout, etc.)
- {test_type}: Unit/Integration/E2E
- {priority_level}: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- {sprint_number}: Current sprint number
- {file_path}: Path to failing test file
- {function_name}: Name of failing function
- {line_number}: Line where failure occurred
- {error_message}: Detailed error message
- {stack_trace}: Full stack trace
- {severity_level}: Impact severity
- {affected_components}: List of affected components
- {timestamp}: Time of failure

## Directory Structure
```
/deliverables
  /backlog
    /sprint-{number}
      /issues
        - BUG-{id}-{test_name}.md
```

## Usage
1. Test runs and fails
2. Script captures failure details
3. Template is loaded and populated
4. New issue is created in current sprint backlog
5. TODO markers are added to relevant code files
6. Backlog is updated with new issue

## Integration Points
- Test runners (Jest, PyTest)
- Version control system
- Sprint management system
- Notification system

## Example
```yaml
# Example bug issue entry in backlog.yaml
issues:
  - id: "BUG-001"
    test_name: "UserAuth_InvalidCredentials"
    type: "unit"
    priority: "high"
    status: "open"
    sprint: 4
    created: "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
```
