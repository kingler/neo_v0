your answer will be directly pasted into the component

> the store script you will write will wrap the root component of the app ; no need to write the wrapper part ; it will be included later as \`<Provider store={store}> <App/> </Provider>\` , where the <App/> is the actual script your will write and export here

for additional reference if needed (ie. in case of auth conditionals)
the code for the global state store component that wraps the app (including this view you're working on) is defined in the following ;
you can import the store exports if needed by using : \`import {...} from '@/store/main'\`
