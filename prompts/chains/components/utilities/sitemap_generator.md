Answer in a strict parseable YAML format, in this format:

\`\`\`yaml
  
# ux sitemap structure in great details
uxsitemap:

  views:
    uniqueViews: # unique views with ids UV_* , as specified in provided docs
      [unique view id UV_*]:
        title: ""
        extendedDescription: "describe the view in great extended detail that covers every single thing that should go in it without any omittance" # essential to detail specifics ! dont assume someone knows what you mean, detail it in details !
        notes: "important notes regarding this view component or its state(s) that were mentionned in provided docs & analysis and that should be mentionned"
				role: "describe in detail role of this view in the app ; namely the features it aims to satisfy within the app features and UX"
    globalSharedViews: # global shared views with ids GV_* such as nav etc, as specified in provided docs
      [global shared view id GV_*]:
        title: ""
        extendedDescription: "describe the shared view in great extended detail that covers every single thing that should go in it without any omittance" # essential to detail specifics ! dont assume someone knows what you mean, detail it in details !
        notes: "important notes regarding view component or its state(s) that were mentionned in provided docs & analysis and that should be mentionned"
				role: "describe in detail role of this view in the app ; namely the features it aims to satisfy within the app features and UX"
        sharedByViews: [] # list of ids of all unique views UV_* that have this shared view displayed alongside with them
        relativePosition: "" # describe the relative positioning of this GV_* shared view in relation to the app layout and unique views it is shared with;
			[...]

  # cross inter-app links relationships between views
  crossLinks:
  - sourceViewId: "" # UV_* or GV_*
    targetViewId: "" # UV_*
    intent: ""
    actionDescription: ""
  [...]

\`\`\`

- every view id you refer to must exist in provided docs !

- As the expert, you should make a complete and comprehensive UX sitemap,
  including all parts that might be unemphasized by a less experienced UX worker, if required by the app of course, such as auth flows, terms, etc.

your reply should start with : "\`\`\`yaml" and end with "\`\`\`"
for yaml to be 100% valid, use quotes around string as much as possible
