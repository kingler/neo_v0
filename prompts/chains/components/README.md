## Component Types

### Backend Generator
Purpose: Generates complete backend implementations including:
- Server setup
- Database operations
- API endpoints
- Authentication
- Real-time features

### Code Rater
Purpose: Evaluates code quality based on:
- Code structure
- Best practices
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Security

### System Prompt
Purpose: Provides core system functionality including:
- Tool management
- Command processing
- Environment handling
- Error management

## Component Integration

Components are integrated into chains through:
1. Chain Imports
   - Components are imported by their parent chains
   - Chains manage component workflow
   - Results flow through chain hierarchy

2. Data Flow
   - Components receive input from chains
   - Process according to their purpose
   - Return results to chain workflow

3. Command Processing
   - Components respond to chain commands
   - Follow consistent interface patterns
   - Maintain chain state awareness

## Usage Guidelines

1. Never use components directly
   - Always access through parent chains
   - Use chain commands from index.md
   - Follow chain workflows

2. Component Updates
   - Update parent chain documentation
   - Maintain consistent interfaces
   - Test chain integration
   - Verify workflows

3. Documentation
   - Keep component docs updated
   - Document integration points
   - Maintain usage examples
   - Update chain references

## Maintenance

When updating components:
1. Follow Interface Standards
   - Maintain consistent APIs
   - Use standard formats
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Document changes

2. Update Documentation
   - Component documentation
   - Chain documentation
   - Main index updates
   - Usage examples

3. Test Integration
   - Chain workflows
   - Command processing
   - Data flow
   - Error handling

4. Verify Functionality
   - Component features
   - Chain integration
   - System stability
   - Performance impact

## Best Practices

1. Component Development
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Maintain clear interfaces
   - Document thoroughly
   - Test extensively

2. Integration
   - Use chain workflows
   - Follow data patterns
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Maintain state properly

3. Documentation
   - Keep docs current
   - Include examples
   - Document changes
   - Update references

## Note

This directory is managed by the chain system. Components should only be modified in coordination with their parent chains and with appropriate updates to system documentation.
