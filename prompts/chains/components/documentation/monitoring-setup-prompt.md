```

## Implementation Process

[STEP 2] For each monitoring domain:

1. Define Key Metrics

   - Frequency
   - Storage requirements

2. Configure Alerts
   - Thresholds
   - Notification channels
   - Escalation policies
   - Response procedures

3. Create Dashboards
   - Layout design
   - Widget configuration
   - Data sources
   - Refresh rates

## Monitoring Categories

    type: gauge
    collection: 60s
    warning: 85%
    critical: 95%
  disk:
    type: gauge
    collection: 300s
    warning: 80%
    critical: 90%
```

### 2. Application Monitoring
```yaml
metrics:
  response_time:
    type: histogram
    collection: 10s
    buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]
    warning: p95 > 2s
    critical: p99 > 5s
  error_rate:
    type: counter
    collection: 60s
    warning: 1%
    critical: 5%
  throughput:
    type: counter
    collection: 60s
    warning: < 100 rps
    critical: < 50 rps
```

### 3. User Experience Monitoring
```yaml
metrics:
  page_load:
    type: histogram
    collection: 60s
    warning: p95 > 3s
    critical: p99 > 5s
  transaction_time:
    type: histogram
    collection: 60s
    warning: p95 > 5s
    critical: p99 > 10s
```

### 4. Security Monitoring
```yaml
metrics:
  failed_logins:
    type: counter
    collection: 300s
    warning: > 10/5m
    critical: > 50/5m
  api_errors:
    type: counter
    collection: 60s
    warning: > 5%
    critical: > 10%
```

## Dashboard Templates

### System Overview Dashboard
```yaml
layout:
  - row:
      - cpu_usage:
          type: graph
          span: 6
      - memory_usage:
          type: graph
          span: 6
  - row:
      - disk_usage:
          type: gauge
          span: 4
      - network_io:
          type: graph
          span: 8
  - row:
      - error_rates:
          type: graph
          span: 12
