# Project README Generator

When asked to generate a README, follow these steps:

1. Scan all available project files and documentation
2. Select the most relevant files and documentation
3. Analyze code structure, dependencies, and configuration files
4. Identify core technologies from package files and code imports
5. Map component relationships through imports and architecture patterns
6. Extract build and run instructions from configuration files
7. Generate a comprehensive README using this structure:

# [Project Name]
