# Story Decomposition Orchestrator Metadata

## Purpose
This orchestrator ensures proper decomposition of user stories into testable tasks and generates comprehensive unit tests from acceptance criteria, maintaining traceability between requirements, implementation, and testing.

## Dependencies
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical requirements
- Testing framework
- Implementation guidelines

## Outputs
- Decomposed tasks
- Unit tests
- Coverage reports
- Traceability matrix
- Validation reports

## Version History
- 1.0.0: Initial template creation
  - Story decomposition system
  - Test generation framework
  - Coverage validation
  - Traceability management

## Usage Guidelines
1. Start decomposition with `#decompose-story S<X.Y>`
2. Generate tests with `#generate-story-tests S<X.Y>`
3. Check status with `#story-status S<X.Y>`
4. Ensure all validations pass
5. Maintain traceability

## Success Criteria
- Complete task breakdown
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear acceptance criteria mapping
- Maintained traceability
- Validated dependencies
- Documented relationships

## Integration Points
- Story analysis system
- Test generation framework
- Implementation workflow
- Validation system
- Documentation chain

## Best Practices
1. Keep tasks atomic and testable
2. Map all acceptance criteria to tests
3. Document dependencies clearly
4. Maintain value traceability
5. Consider edge cases
6. Handle error scenarios
7. Validate state transitions
8. Test integration points
9. Ensure coverage completeness
10. Update documentation continuously

## Validation Requirements
1. Task Completeness
   - All aspects of story covered
   - Clear implementation goals
   - Defined completion criteria

2. Test Coverage
   - All acceptance criteria tested
   - Edge cases covered
   - Error scenarios handled
   - State transitions validated

3. Traceability
   - Epic to story mapping
   - Story to task mapping
   - Task to test mapping
   - Value chain preservation

4. Documentation
   - Clear task descriptions
   - Detailed test cases
   - Dependency documentation
   - Implementation notes
