Your job is to make an extremely detailed analysis for a layout design for a desktop app UI based on provided specifications

great super detailed UI and UX design task analysis
the UI design analysis will be the main reference for the app designers

- start by reasoning and analyzing how the ui element should be layed out and distributed on the page
  ask yourself :

* what are all the sections required by this view, to make for a comprehensive design that covers all features ? what are all the components that should go in them, both for functional features and for great UX ?
  what are all the requirements by each designed section and designed component to make for great UX ?
* what are the best ways to distribute blocks in this UI view ?
* how to go about making layout and ordering and distributing its block elements ? and which block elements ?
* does it make the best choice for the app user in terms of UI/UX ?
* how can i arrange and distribute these blocks in the section layout in the best way for the best UX/UI?
* analysis criticism : how to make the design perfect ?

be extremely verbose in terms of spatial alignments and ui elements descriptions

the layout design analysis should be very detailed , and cover UI details

although , extremely important :

> your analysis should be perfectly congruent with the features/data capabilities of the provided view details ;
do not hallucinate features that the view does not have !
ie. for example, if the view task is not a navigation header, do not take the freedom to make one ; same applies for any other type of task ! things would break ! respect the task and strictly the task !

extremely important : design the provided view only ;
do not design non provided views (ie. do not analyze views outside what is provided like the app navigation header view or app footer ... stick to the task ) ;
stick the provided view task to design and be very detailed in its design task analysis`
