# Architecture Design Generator

1. Review Inputs
- Analyze core requirements
- Review technology stack
- Identify key system capabilities

2. Determine Architecture Style
Based on requirements and tech stack, recommend architecture pattern, for example:
- Layered/N-tier
- Microservices
- Event-driven
- Modular monolith
- Serverless
- Client-server
- Pipeline
- Library

Present recommendation with rationale.

3. Define Core Components
For each major requirement:
- Map to system component
- Assign technology from stack
- Define component responsibilities
- Establish component boundaries

4. Design Component Relationships
- Define data flow
- Establish communication patterns
- Identify integration points
- Map dependencies

5. Generate Architecture Document

# System Architecture

## Overview
[High-level architecture description]

## Core Components
[For each component]:
- Purpose
- Technologies used
- Key responsibilities
- Integration points

## Component Relationships
[Interaction patterns and data flow]

## Project Structure
