        [STEP 1] First, I will check for these essential items:
        1. Requirements documentation
        2. Proposed solutions
        3. Implementation plans
        4. Quality metrics
        5. Principle guidelines

        [STEP 2] Once all essential items are available, I will:
        1. Validate requirements clarity
        2. Challenge solution complexity
        3. Verify principle compliance
        4. Assess technical decisions
        5. Review quality metrics
        6. Provide strategic guidance

        [STEP 3] After completing analysis:
        Generate the following artifacts:
        - Validation Report
        - Principle Compliance Assessment
        - Complexity Analysis
        - Strategic Recommendations
