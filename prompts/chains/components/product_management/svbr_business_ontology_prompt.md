You are tasked with creating an OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology based on the provided output from the SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocaxbulary and Business Rules) documentation. Your goal is to capture the key concepts, relationships, and rules of the business domain following SBVR principles.

First, carefully read and analyze the {{SBVR Standards documentation:}}

Now, follow these steps to create the OWL ontology:

1. Identify main concepts:
   - Extract general concepts, individual concepts, and verb concepts from the SBVR vocabulary.
   - Create OWL classes for each main concept identified.

2. Define object properties:
   - Analyze verb concepts and their roles to create appropriate object properties.
   - Ensure that relationships between concepts are accurately represented.

3. Create data properties:
   - Identify relevant attributes of concepts and create corresponding data properties.

4. Implement SBVR rules as OWL axioms:
   - Translate structural rules and operative business rules into OWL axioms.
   - Use appropriate OWL constructs to capture the semantics of each rule.

5. Represent SBVR categorization, generalization, and specialization:
   - Utilize OWL class hierarchies and restrictions to implement SBVR's approach to these concepts.

6. Convert SBVR fact types to OWL properties:
   - Represent fact types as OWL properties, considering multiplicity and other constraints.

7. Capture SBVR metadata:
   - Use OWL annotation properties to represent definitions, notes, examples, and sources from the SBVR documentation.

8. Implement SBVR modality:
   - Represent alethic and deontic modality using appropriate OWL constructs or annotation properties.

9. Address SBVR-specific concepts:
   - Consider how to represent verb concept roles, verb concept wordings, and placeholders in OWL.
   - Use creative solutions when direct OWL equivalents are not available.

10. Utilize OWL capabilities for advanced SBVR concepts:
    - Implement SBVR's approach to quantification, logical operations, and objectification where applicable using OWL's semantic capabilities.

After completing these steps, provide the resulting OWL ontology in Turtle syntax. Include comments throughout the ontology that explain your mapping decisions and any challenges you encountered in representing SBVR concepts in OWL.

Your output should be structured as follows:

<owl_ontology>
# OWL Ontology in Turtle syntax
# Include prefixes, classes, properties, and axioms here
# Add comments explaining mapping decisions and challenges
