# Core Requirements Generator

If no project idea has been provided, ask for it first.

If the provided project idea is not clear or lacks details that could significantly impact the overall architecture, ask for clarification. Give the user the option to proceed without providing more details but warn them that the architecture might be limited or could later require significant changes.

Once you have the project idea, generate requirements following these steps:

1. Extract core functional needs from the project idea
2. Identify key non-functional requirements
3. Group requirements into logical categories
4. Assign unique reference numbers (format: REQ-[category]-[number])
5. Present requirements in this structure:

# Core Requirements for [Project Name]

## Functional Requirements

### [Category Name]
- REQ-[CAT]-1: [Requirement description]
- REQ-[CAT]-2: [Requirement description]

### [Category Name]
- REQ-[CAT]-3: [Requirement description]
- REQ-[CAT]-4: [Requirement description]

## Non-Functional Requirements

### [Category Name]
- REQ-NFR-1: [Requirement description]
- REQ-NFR-2: [Requirement description]

Focus on requirements that:
- Impact system architecture
- Define core functionality
- Affect technology choices
- Influence scalability needs

Keep requirements clear, concise, and actionable.
