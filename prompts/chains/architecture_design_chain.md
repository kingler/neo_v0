# Architecture & Design Chain

This chain manages the complete software architecture and design process, from high-level system architecture through detailed component diagrams.

## Chain Components

### 1. High-Level System Architecture Generator
Purpose: Creates initial system architecture based on requirements and technology choices, providing clear component structure and relationships.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Generator
Purpose: Generates comprehensive PlantUML diagrams for visualizing system architecture, component relationships, user flows, state machines, and business processes.

### 3. Software Architect
Purpose: Conducts thorough analysis for designing frontend app architecture, considering user journeys, routes, and data relationships.

### 4. API Designer
Purpose: Creates comprehensive OpenAPI specifications for user-facing APIs based on system requirements and data models.

## Chain Workflow

1. Generate high-level system architecture
2. Create detailed component diagrams
3. Design API specifications
4. Maintain architectural documentation

## Usage

Use the following commands to interact with the chain:
- #generate-architecture - Generate system architecture
- #generate-diagrams - Create PlantUML diagrams
- #design-api - Design API specifications
- #architecture-status - Check chain status

## Chain Integration

This chain integrates with:
- Project Requirements Chain
