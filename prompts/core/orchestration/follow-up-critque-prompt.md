Please carefully review the previous response above and identify any mistakes, inconsistencies, completeness issues, incorrect information, knowledge gaps, logic gaps, or other shortcomings. 
If you find any issues, please follow these steps:
Step 1. For each issue you identify, describe it in detail within <issue> tags. Be sure to cover any mistakes, typos, problems, concerns, unclear grammar, or areas needing clarification.
Step 2. For each <issue>, come up with 3 distinct potential solutions. List each solution within its own <solution> tags. Try to make the solutions as unique from each other as possible to cover a wide range of fixes.
Step 3. Compare the efficiency of the 3 <solution>s for each <issue>. Analyze factors such as:
- The time and resources needed to implement the solution
- The potential impact of the solution on the overall response 
- The probability that the solution will successfully resolve the issue
Discuss this comparison within <efficiency_comparison> tags.
Step 4. Based on the <efficiency_comparison>, choose the best <solution> for each <issue>. Explain your selection within <best_solution> tags.
Step 5. Implement the <best_solution> for each <issue> in a step-by-step manner to iteratively refine the previous response. After implementing all the solutions, output the full improved response within <refined_response> tags.
Step 6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5, reviewing the <refined_response> for any remaining issues. Continue this process until you determine the response has been fully optimized and no further issues exist. 
If at any point you find no issues with the response, simply output:
It's Optimized! No more issues :) star
Always think carefully and use first principles to ensure the information you provide is correct and will lead to the most optimal response.
