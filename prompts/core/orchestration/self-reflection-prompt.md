# Self-Reflection Prompt Template

## Core Structure

When answering this question, please follow these steps:

1. Initial Thoughts
   - What is my immediate understanding of the question?
   - What assumptions am I making?
   - What potential biases might influence my response?

2. Knowledge Assessment
   - What relevant information do I have about this topic?
   - What are the gaps in my knowledge?
   - What are the limitations of my training data that might affect my response?

3. Reasoning Process
   - Break down the problem into smaller components
   - Consider multiple perspectives and approaches
   - Identify potential logical fallacies
   - Question my own conclusions

4. Alternative Viewpoints
   - What are other possible interpretations?
   - What counterarguments exist?
   - What edge cases should I consider?

5. Confidence Assessment
   - How certain am I about each part of my response?
   - What factors might affect the reliability of my answer?
   - Where might I need to express uncertainty?

6. Final Response
   - Synthesize insights from the reflection process
   - Clearly state any important caveats or limitations
   - Provide a well-reasoned, balanced answer

## Example Implementation

Question: "What will be the impact of artificial intelligence on employment?"

### 1. Initial Thoughts
I notice I might have biases from:
- Training data potentially overrepresenting certain perspectives
- Current media narratives about AI and jobs
- Limited exposure to diverse economic contexts

### 2. Knowledge Assessment
I have information about:
- Historical technological transitions
- Current AI capabilities and limitations
- Economic theory about automation
Gaps include:
- Real-time data on AI adoption rates
- Specific regional impacts
- Long-term societal adaptations

## Best Practices

1. Explicit Reasoning
   - Show your work
   - Explain key decision points
   - Highlight important assumptions

2. Balanced Analysis
   - Consider both positive and negative aspects
   - Acknowledge complexity
   - Avoid oversimplification

3. Uncertainty Communication
   - Use precise language about confidence levels
   - Identify speculative elements
   - Acknowledge limitations

4. Structured Output
   - Organize thoughts clearly
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Build logical progression

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Overconfidence
   - Claiming certainty without sufficient evidence
   - Failing to acknowledge limitations
   - Overlooking alternative perspectives

2. Confirmation Bias
   - Seeking only supporting evidence
   - Dismissing contradictory information
   - Sticking to initial assumptions

3. False Precision
   - Making overly specific predictions
   - Providing exact numbers without sufficient data
   - Failing to account for uncertainty

4. Scope Creep
   - Straying from the original question
   - Adding unnecessary complexity
   - Losing focus on core issues

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Customize the template based on:
   - Question complexity
   - Required depth of analysis
   - Time constraints
   - Audience needs

2. Maintain consistent structure while allowing flexibility in:
   - Depth of each section
   - Focus areas
   - Level of detail
   - Technical complexity

3. Regular refinement based on:
   - User feedback
   - Performance metrics
   - Error patterns
   - New insights
