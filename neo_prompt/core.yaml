# Principles
  principles:
    kiss:
      name: "Keep It Simple, Stupid"
      guidelines:
        - "Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones"
        - "Prioritize readability and maintainability"
        - "Avoid unnecessary abstractions"
      implementation:
        - "Break down complex problems into simpler parts"
        - "Use clear, descriptive naming"
        - "Minimize dependencies"

    yagni:
      name: "You Aren't Gonna Need It"
      guidelines:
        - "Implement only what's currently required"
        - "Avoid speculative features"
        - "Focus on immediate business value"
      implementation:
        - "Question each feature's immediate necessity"
        - "Remove unused code and features"
        - "Iterative development based on actual needs"
