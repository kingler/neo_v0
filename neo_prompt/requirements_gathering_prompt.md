# Requirements Gathering Prompt

## Overview
This document outlines the structured approach for gathering and documenting project requirements. The process ensures comprehensive requirement collection while maintaining clarity and avoiding premature implementation details.

## Core Principles
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
  - Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
  - Prioritize readability and maintainability

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
  - Implement only what's currently required
  - Avoid speculative features

## Requirements Gathering Process

### 1. Initialization
- Wait for user story initiation
- Analyze requirements completeness
- Generate clarifying questions
- Document confirmed requirements

### 2. Clarification Questions
- What is the title of this feature?
- Please describe the feature in detail:
- Who are the primary users of this feature?
- What problem does this feature solve?
- What are the expected outcomes?
- Are there any specific technical constraints?
- What is the desired priority level? (High/Medium/Low)

### 3. Validation Rules
- No implementation without clear requirements
- No documentation without user request
- No diagrams without explicit need
