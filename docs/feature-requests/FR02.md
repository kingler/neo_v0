# FR02: Enhanced Neo LLM Capabilities with Code Context Management

## Overview
This feature request outlines improvements to Neo's code generation and management capabilities, focusing on context awareness, code safety, and testing integration.

## Requirements Checklist

### 1. LLM Integration Enhancement
- [ ] Install and configure LLM library
  - [ ] Add OpenAI library integration
  - [ ] Configure API key management
  - [ ] Set up environment variables for secure key storage

### 2. Dynamic Context Graph Management
- [ ] Implement automatic graph updates for new code
  - [ ] Scan existing context graph
  - [ ] Detect new code files and functions
  - [ ] Update graph with new dependencies
  - [ ] Validate graph integrity after updates

### 3. Scratch Pad Implementation
- [ ] Create scratch pad system for code updates
  - [ ] Implement file backup mechanism
  - [ ] Integrate with context graph for analysis
  - [ ] Set up diff tool integration
  - [ ] Create restore points for safety

### 4. Code Safety and Validation
- [ ] Implement code validation system
  - [ ] Create diff comparison logic
  - [ ] Add detection for accidental code removal
  - [ ] Implement automatic code restoration
  - [ ] Add user notification system for changes
  - [ ] Create logging system for restoration events

### 5. Test Integration System
- [ ] Enhance test management capabilities
  - [ ] Implement test file detection
  - [ ] Create test update mechanism
  - [ ] Add test execution integration
  - [ ] Implement test result analysis
  - [ ] Add test creation suggestions
  - [ ] Create test report generation

## Technical Details

### Context Graph Integration
```yaml
update_events:
  - new_file_creation
  - function_addition
  - dependency_changes
  - code_modifications
```

### Validation Messages
- On accidental code removal:
  ```
  "Oops, I accidentally removed the [Function/Variable/Method/Class] code. Let me add it back."
  ```

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully updates context graph with new code
2. Maintains code integrity during updates
3. Prevents accidental code loss
4. Ensures test coverage for code changes
5. Provides clear feedback on all operations

## Dependencies
- OpenAI library
- Diff tool integration
- Test runner framework
- Context graph system
